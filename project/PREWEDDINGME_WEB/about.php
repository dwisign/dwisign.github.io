			Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
			Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
			when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
			specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
			into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
			in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
			and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
			versions of Lorem Ipsum.</br></br>

			Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
			It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
			Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of 
			the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites 
			of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
