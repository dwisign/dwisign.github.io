									<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
									Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
									when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
									specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
									electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
									in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
									and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
									versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

									<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
									It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
									making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
									at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
									Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
									the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable 
									source.</p>
