							<b>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s</b><br>

							electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
							in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
							and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including

							at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
							Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
							the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable 
							source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus 
							Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written 
							in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular 
							during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor 
							sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
